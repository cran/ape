The following persons and institutions helped in the development of
APE at one stage or another.

  Many users gave important feed-back with their encouragements,
  comments, or bug reports: thanks to all of you!

  Significant bug fixes were provided by Éric Durand, Olivier
  François, Bret Larget, and Li-San Wang. Contact me if I forgot
  someone.

  Kurt Hornik, of the R Core Team, helped in several occasions to
  fix some problems and bugs.

  Financial support was provided in the early development of APE by
  the French "Programme inter-EPST Bioinformatique" (2001-2003).
