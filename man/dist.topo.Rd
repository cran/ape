\title{Topological Distances Between Two Trees}
\description{
  This function computes the topological distance between two
  phylogenetic trees or among trees in a list (if \code{y = NULL} using
  different methods.
}
\usage{
dist.topo(x, y = NULL, method = "PH85")
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{an object of class \code{"phylo"} or of class
    \code{"multiPhylo"}.}
  \item{y}{an (optional) object of class \code{"phylo"}.}
  \item{method}{a character string giving the method to be used: either
    \code{"PH85"}, or \code{"score"}.}
}
\value{
  a single numeric value if both \code{x} and \code{y} are used, an
  object of class \code{"dist"} otherwise.
}
\details{
  Two methods are available: the one by Penny and Hendy (1985,
  originally from Robinson and Foulds 1981), and the branch length score
  by Kuhner and Felsenstein (1994). The trees are always considered as
  unrooted.

  The topological distance is defined as twice the number of internal
  branches defining different bipartitions of the tips (Robinson and
  Foulds 1981; Penny and Hendy 1985). Rzhetsky and Nei (1992) proposed a
  modification of the original formula to take multifurcations into
  account.

  The branch length score may be seen as similar to the previous
  distance but taking branch lengths into account. Kuhner and
  Felsenstein (1994) proposed to calculate the square root of the sum of
  the squared differences of the (internal) branch lengths defining
  similar bipartitions (or splits) in both trees.
