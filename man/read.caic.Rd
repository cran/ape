\title{Read Tree File in CAIC Format}
\description{
This function reads one tree from a CAIC file.
A second file containing branch lengths values may also be passed (experimental).
}
\usage{
read.caic(file, brlen = NULL, skip = 0, comment.char = "#", ...)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{a file name specified by either a variable of mode character, or a double-quoted string.}
  \item{brlen}{a file name for the branch lengths file.}
  \item{skip}{the number of lines of the input file to skip before beginning to read data (this is passed directly to scan()).}
  \item{comment.char}{a single character, the remaining of the line after this character is ignored (this is passed directly to scan()).}
  \item{\dots}{Further arguments to be passed to scan().}
}
\details{
  Read a tree from a file in the format used by the CAIC and MacroCAIc program.

## The same example than in read.tree, without branch lengths.
