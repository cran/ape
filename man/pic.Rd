\title{Phylogenetically Independent Contrasts}
\description{
  Compute the phylogenetically independent contrasts using the method
  described by Felsenstein (1985).
}
\usage{
pic(x, phy, scaled = TRUE, var.contrasts = FALSE,
    rescaled.tree = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{a numeric vector.}
  \item{phy}{an object of class \code{"phylo"}.}
  \item{scaled}{logical, indicates whether the contrasts should be
    scaled with their expected variances (default to \code{TRUE}).}
  \item{var.contrasts}{logical, indicates whether the expected
    variances of the contrasts should be returned (default to
    \code{FALSE}).}
  \item{rescaled.tree}{logical, if \code{TRUE} the rescaled tree is
    returned together with the main results.}
}
\details{
  If \code{x} has names, its values are matched to the tip labels of
  \code{phy}, otherwise its values are taken to be in the same order
  than the tip labels of \code{phy}.

  The user must be careful here since the function requires that both
  series of names perfectly match. If both series of names do not match,
  the values in the \code{x} are taken to be in the same order than the
  tip labels of \code{phy}, and a warning message is issued.
}
\value{
  either a vector of phylogenetically independent contrasts (if
  \code{var.contrasts = FALSE}), or a two-column matrix with the
  phylogenetically independent contrasts in the first column and their
  expected variance in the second column (if \code{var.contrasts =
  TRUE}). If the tree has node labels, these are used as labels of the
  returned object.

  If \code{rescaled.tree = TRUE}, a list is returned with two elements
  named ``contr'' with the above results and ``rescaled.tree'' with the
  tree and its rescaled branch lengths (see Felsenstein 1985).
